# book_manager 

ill call it DR.BOOKMAN

The program is like a  bookshelf assistant. It allows you to add new books to your shelf, remove books you no longer need or want, view a list of all your books, and even save this list to a file to find it later.

Each book has three main details: its title, its author, and the year it was published.

There's a menu to help you decide what you want to do next, whether you wanna add a new book, remove an old one, view your bookshelf, or save your book list.
